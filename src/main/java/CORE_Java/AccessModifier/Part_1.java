 A java program can contain anu no of class bt at most one class can be
 Declared as public if there is public class then name of the program and the of the

 If the class B is public then name of the program should be b.jva otherwise we will get
 compile time error shying class B is public should be declared in the file named B.java

 More than one public class we cannot declare in a file
 Wewill get compile time error
when ever we are compile a java program for every class present in the program a
 separate .class file will be generated
 Wecan compile a java program(Java source file) bt we can dun a java.class file
 When ever we are executing a java class the corresponding class main method is
 execute
 If a class does not contain main method then we will get run time exception saying no
 such method error- main
 If the corresponding .class file not available then we will get run time error saying so
 class def found error.
