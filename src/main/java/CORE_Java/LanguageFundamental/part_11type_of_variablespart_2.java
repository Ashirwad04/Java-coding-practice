Fundamentals Part-11 || Types of Variables:part-2
 3 local variables
 The variable which is declared inside a block , method , constructor for a
 temporary use is known as local variable it is also known as Temporary variable
 and stored in stack so also known as stack variable. Also automatic variables
 The local variable will be created while executing in which we declare it and the
 variable will be destroyed when block execution completes .
 Local variables are thread safe .
 For local variables to not provide default values we should make initialization
 compulsory .
 The only applicable modifier for local variable is final .
 If we try to apply ano other modifier we will get compile time error.
 Conclusion
 If we are not declaring with any modifier then by default it is default but this is
 applicable only for instance and static variable but not for local variable .
 For local initialization explesitelty bt for instance and static it is not compulsory
 Instance variable are not thread safe static are also not thread safe local variable
 are theread safe
 Every varibin java is must be instance static or local variable
 Or primitive or reference.
