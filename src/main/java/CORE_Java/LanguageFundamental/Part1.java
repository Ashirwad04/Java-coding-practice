    name in java program are known as identifiers
    which can be used for identification purpose
    it can be class name, variable name, methods name.


    there are 5 identification in this  public static void main(String[] args) {}

    Rules for making identifiers
        -# ,@ is not allowed to use in identifiers name .
                we will get compile time error
        - name cant start with digit or numeric no
                total123 is valid , 123total invalid
         java identifiers are case-sensitive
                 so int num =10; intNum= 12 ; and intNUM = 22; all treated as different num ;
         There is no length limit for identifiers in java,
                but it is not recommended to take to long name

         We cant use reserved name as identifiers
             int if = 10 ; compile time error

          only alowed A-Z,a-z,1-0,$,_,


        in java some words are reserve words there are 53 reserved words
            total 53

       48 used keywords     un used keywords 2   - goto,const
       if else switch ......

       unused keyword -2 this keyword are not allowed if we are try to use we will get compile time error
       goto - uses pf go to creates lots of problems in old language so that's why some people have baned this keyword in java
       const- use final instead of const

       reserved literals -3
       true
       false
       null - default for object reference


       enum 1.5 v - when we want to define a group of named constants



    conclusion
        -all 53 keyword will contains only a-z and small case
        -o delete keyword because destruction of useless object is responsibility of garbage collectors
        - the following are new keyword in java
                strictfp    1.2
                assert       1.4
