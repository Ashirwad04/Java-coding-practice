literals


int x = 10;

int is a keyword
x is the name or identifier
10 us a constant value or we can call it a literal

any constant value that can be assigned to a variable is called a literal.

1 decimal literal

2 octal form

3 hex decimal form


integral literals - for integral data type (byte , short int , long ) we can specify literal value in the following ways
1 decimal form (base 10) allowed digits are 0-9
ex int x = 10;


2 octal form (base 8) allowed digits are 0 to 7
literal value should be prefixed with 0;
example int x= 010;



3 Hexa decimal form base (16) allowed digit are   both aA to

this is one of few are where java is not a case sensitive the litral value shoud be prefixed with 0x or 0X
int x=0x10;


there is no direct way to specify byte and short literals
but indirectly e can specify


floating point literals

float f=123.456; pop error found double
float f=123.456F; ok
double d=123.456; ok

by default every floating-point literal is double and hence we cant assign directly to the float variable
but we can specify floating-point literal as float type sufficed with small f or F .
