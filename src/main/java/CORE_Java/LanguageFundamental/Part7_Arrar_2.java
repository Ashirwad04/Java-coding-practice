2 Dimensional array creation

In java 2 d array not implemented by using matrix style some people followed an array of arrays approach for multi dimensional array creation .
The main advantage of this approach is the memory utilization will be improved

Example one
Int [ ][ ] x=new int [2][ ];
X[ 0] = new int [2];
x[1]= new int [j];

Example 2

Int [][][] x=new int [2][][];
x[0]=new int [3][];
x[0][0]= new int [1];
x[0][1]= new int [2];
x[0][2]= new inr [3];

x[1]= new int [2][2];



Whane ever we are trineg to print any reference variable internally too string method will be called which is implemented by default to return the string in the following form

Example

Int [][]x=new int[2][3];
sout(x);
sout(x[0]);
sout(x[0][0]);






Default value  is by default 0

Int [] x= new int [6];
x[0]=10;
x[1]=11;
x[2]=12;
x[3]=13;
x[4]=14;
x[5]=15;
 Every array element is initialized with default value 0 but we can override with customized values

If we use more range of array then we will get array index out of bond exxecption
