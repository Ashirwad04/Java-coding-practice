 Core Java with OCJP/SCJP: Operators &
 Assignments Part-5 ||Assignment,conditional,new
 Operators
 Assignment operator
 There are 3 types of assignment type operator
 1 simple assignment type
 2 chained assignment type
 3 Compound assignment type operator
 Simple assignment type
 Int x=10;
 Chained assignment type
 a=b=c=d=d=20;
 Compound assignment type
 a+=20
 Int a=b=c=d=20;
 It will throw compile time error
 Wecannot perform chained assignment directly at the time of declaration .
 Int b,c,d;
 Int a=b=c=20; this is valid
Compound assignment operator
 Int a=10;
 a+=20;
 sout(a); 30
 Some time assignment opp mixed with other opp such tupe of assignment opp are
 known as compound assignment opp
 The following are all possible compound assignment opp
 +=-=
 *=
 /=
 %=
 &=
 |=
 ^=
 >>=
 >>>=
 <<=
 Byte b =10;
 b=b+1;
 Sout (b);
 Byte b=10
 B++;
 sout(b)
 Byte b =10;
 b+=1;
 sout(b);
 Compile time error pop
 11 will be and
 11 will be ans
Conditional operator (?:)
 This type of oppp called urinary opp
 a++;
 ++a;
 A+b this type of opp are known as binary opp
 The only posible ternary opp in java
 Int x=(10>20)?30:((40>50)?60:70)
 sout(x);70
 Wecan perform nesting of conditional opp also
 New operator
 To create a new object
 Test A= new Test();
 After creating an object constutructor will be executed to perform initialization of the
 object hence construtur is not for creating of the object and it is for initialization of the
 object
 In java we have only new keyword bt no delete keyword because destruction of useless
 object is the responsibility of garbage collector
