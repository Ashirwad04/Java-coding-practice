 1-Increment and decrement Operators
 2-Arithmetic operator
 3-String concatenation operator
 4-Relational operator
 5-Equality operator
 6-Instanceof operator
 7-Bitwise operator
 8-Short circuit operator
 9-Type cast operator
 10-Assignment operator
 11-New operator
 12-[ ] operator
 13-Operator precedence
 14-Evaluation order of operator
 15-New vs new instance()
 16-Instance vs isInstance()
 17-classNotFoundException vs NoClassDefError
 1-Increment and decrement Operators
 Pre increment operator
 y=++x;
 Post increment
 y=x++;
Increment and decrement only work on variable not on constant values
 But we are try to appy on const value then we will get compile time error
 Int x=10;
 Int y=++(++x);
 This will also be a compile time error because after increment x will become 11 and that
 is constant .
 Listing of increment and decrement is not allowed
 Wecant apply this on boolean
 Wewill get compile time error
 Wecan apply this on all primitive types except boolean .
