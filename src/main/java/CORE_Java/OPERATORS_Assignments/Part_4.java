Core Java with OCJP/SCJP: Operators &
Assignments Part-4 || short-circuit,type cast
operators
 Short circuit operator  && , ||
 & ,|
Both argument will be test
Relative performance is high
Applicable for both boolean and
Integram type
Type cast operator
There are 2 type of type casting
Implicit type casting
Explicit type casting
Implicit type casting -
Int x=’a’;
 sout(x);
 &&,||
 Second arg evlution is optional
rElatively performance high
Applicable for only boolean
 Compiler coverts char to int  automatically by implicit type cating
Double d=10;
 sout(d);
 Internally converts int to double by implicit type casting
 When small data type to bigger data type variable then impleseit type casting is
perform
In implicit type casting no data loss is there .
Int c=130;
 Byte b=x; rase compile time error possible loss of persian int required byte
 Byte b =(byte)x;
Programer is responsible for explicit type casting
 In explicit type casting data loss may be there
 Bigger data type to smaller data type
Int x=150;
 Short s=(short)x;
 short(s)
 Byte b=(byte)x;
 sout(b);
