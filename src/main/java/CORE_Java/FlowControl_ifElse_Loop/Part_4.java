 Core Java with OCJP/SCJP: Flow-Control Part-4 ||
 Iterative Statements: while,do-while
 If we don't know the number of iteration in advance then we have to go for while loop
 And of we know the number of iteration in advance then we should go for for loop
 Syntax
 white(b){
 Action
 }
 In this argument(b) should be a boolean type if we use any other type then it wil get compile
 time error.
 while(1){
 sout(“hellow”);
 }
 Wewill get error incompatible type found int required boolean
 Curly brasses are optional
 But we can write only one statement but it shold not me declarative statement
 Every final variable will be replaced by the value yet compile time only
 Final int int a=10;
 Int b=20;
 sout(a);10
 sout(b);b
 If every argument is final variable (compile time constant ) then the operation should be
 performed compile time only
DOWHILE
 If we want to execute loop body at least once then we should go for do while
 Do{
 }
 while(b);
 In old ; is mandatory bt in jaba its optional
 Curly braces are option
